# Task ID: 1
# Title: Establish Design System Foundation in Tailwind and Install Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing Tailwind CSS configuration to include the new design system (colors, typography, spacing) and install all required new dependencies for advanced animations and interactions.
# Details:
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install framer-motion@^11 lucide-react@^0 lenis@^1 react-intersection-observer@^9 @react-three/fiber@^8 @react-three/drei@^9 three@^0.16 lottie-react@^2`. 
2. **Update Tailwind Config**: Modify `tailwind.config.ts` to extend `theme` with the new color palette (primary blue gradient, secondary purple, neon accents), typography (Inter, JetBrains Mono), and spacing scale. 
3. **Create Utilities**: Add custom utilities for glassmorphism (`.glass`, `.glass-dark`), neumorphism shadows, and gradient text. 
4. **Animation Variants**: Create `/apps/web/src/components/animations/variants.ts` to define reusable Framer Motion variants (fadeIn, slideUp, scale, stagger) with specified durations and easing.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all new dependencies are installed and the application builds successfully. Check that new color, font, and spacing utilities are available and can be applied to components. Create a test page to render elements with the new styles and Framer Motion variants to confirm they work as expected.
